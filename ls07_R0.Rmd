# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The basic reproduction number (R~0~) is an indicator of the transmissibility of infectious agents. It represents the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case in a population that is fully susceptible to infection.

It is used to answer the question: under what conditions will an infectious disease invade a system?

Calculating R~0~ can inform public health policy decisions to prevent and control epidemics.

Let's get started!

# Basic Reproduction Number (R~0~)

## Defining R~0~

The **basic reproduction number (R~0~)** is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by one infected case in an entirely susceptible population.

For example, if the R~0~ is 2, then one infected person will infect, on average, two new people before they recover.

![](images/r0_of_2.gif)

The definition assumes that there is only one infectious individual at the start, and no other individuals are infected or immunized.

It determines whether a pathogen can invade and spread in a population.

-   If $R_0 > 1$, the infection is expected to spread and "invade" the population, causing an epidemic.![](images/clipboard-3396334041.png){width="453"}
-   If $R_0 < 1$, the infection is expected to die out and go "extinct", because on average an infectious person is expected to transmit to fewer than 1 other susceptibles.

::: vocab
**R~0~ Terminology and Notation**

The basic reproduction number (R~0~) is also known as the basic reproduction ratio or the basic reproductive rate. It is generally pronounced “R nought,” but you may also hear it being pronounced as "R zero".

The symbol *R* stands for reproduction. Naught, or zero, stands for the zeroth generation (patient zero). It refers to the first patient infected by a disease in an epidemic, also referred to as the index case.

**Practice Question 1**

Answer TRUE or FALSE to the following statement:

> When $R_0 = 2$ then each infected person will go on to infect exactly 2 susceptible individuals.

## History of the Basic Reproduction Number (R~0~)

The concept of a reproduction number (or ratio) was first introduced in the field of mathematical demography, which is the study of population dynamics. In demography and ecology, R~0~ is a measure of reproduction rate in a group of people or animals and used it to count offspring.

In the 1950s, epidemiologist George MacDonald suggested using R~0~ to describe the transmission potential of malaria. When R~0~ was adopted for use by epidemiologists, the objects being counted were infected cases.

![Ref: Eisenberg (2020)](images/mcdonald_R0.jpg)

> It took a long time for modelers in epidemiology to realize that **thinking in terms of reproduction potential is a clear and powerful concept for infectious diseases**. The use of R0 finally took off when it was found that the value could be estimated from readily available data. - Hans Heesterbeek, A brief history of R0 (2002)

Since then the reproduction number has become widely used in the field of epidemiology.

# What is an epidemic?

> **Epidemic** refers to an unexpected increase, often sudden, in the number of disease cases above what is normally expected in that population in that area. - *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)*

![COVID-19 incidence in Victoria, Australia, 2020](images/covid_aus_2020.jpg)

While there is no universal consensus on the defintion of "epidemic", three important characteristics appear in most definitions:

1.  **Boundary**: limited by geography or population

2.  **Chronology**: take place during a specific period of time, with a clear beginning and end

3.  **Trigger**: epidemic and outbreaks are caused by a triggering event, be it a pathogen or other change in the system

Let's take a closer look at the trajectories of each of these epidemic curves:

![](images/bell_shaped_curves.gif)

We can identify key stages of an epidemic, and describe them in terms of pathogen population biology:

![](images/bell_shaped_curve_phases.jpg){width="433"}

Key questions are:

-   **Why did an epidemic start?** What caused the sudden change in incidence or prevalence?

-   **When can an infectious disease establish?** What was it about this particular scenario that made it possible for the pathogen to invade?

-   **When can the disease persist?** Once the pathogen emerges, will it be able to sustain the epidemic for a long time? Or will it cause a few cases and then fade out?

-   **Can we eradicate the disease?** How can we prevent a pathogen from invading a population?

# Moving from Individual to Population Scale

Let's revisit our classic SIR model framework:

![Note that all compartments and parameters refer to the numbers or rates of individuals.](images/bath_tub_sir_model_colored.png)

When developing a compartmental model, we focus on interactions at the **individual level**.

We categorize individuals into compartments based on their infection or immune status: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), or Recovered (R). Using a system of ODEs, we incorporate parameters for transmission (β) and recovery (γ) to determine the rate of "flows" between compartments, as individuals transition from S to I to R.

![The ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the classic SIR model.](images/bath_tub_odes.png){width="479"}

The consequences of individual interactions determine epidemic dynamics at the **population level**.

![](images/infection_dynamics.gif){width="500"}

## Simulating Population-level Epidemic Trajectories

Solving a system of ODEs for an SIR model allows us to approximate the total number of susceptible, infected, or recovered individuals in a population over time. This gives us a summary of transmission dynamics at a larger scale, represented by curves such as the ones below.

![Infectious disease dynamics predicted by deterministic SIR model.](images/clipboard-1716752465.png){width="500"}

Epidemic trajectories differ according to model parameters such as β and γ.

The figure below shows epidemic model outputs for a closed population with identical starting conditions, simulated at different transmission and recovery rates.

![Epidemic trajectories differ according to model parameters. Blue = Susceptible, Green = Infected.](images/simulating_sir_varying_parameters.png)

We can see that as the β and γ parameters are varied, the model predicts different outcomes:

-   There are several scenarios with no epidemic takeoff, when transmission (β) is slow and recovery (γ) is fast.

-   As β increases from left to right, we see curves with steeper slopes, higher peaks, earlier turnover, and shorter epidemics. Faster transmission rates means that the infection spreads more rapidly, but it also means that you quickly run out of susceptibles.

-   As γ decreases from top to bottom, we again see curves with steeper slopes and higher peaks, but *later* turnover and *longer* epidemics. This makes intuitive sense -- if individuals stay infectious for a longer period, it takes longer for the epidemic to die out.

While these simulations help us understand the how each scenario was shaped by the parameters, we want to be able to anticipate trajectories without simulating the model outputs each time.

How can we anticipate trajectories without resorting to extensive numerical integration?

Calculating the **invasion threshold** for a disease can help us answer a key question:

> *Under what conditions will an infectious disease invade a system?*

# Mathematical derivation of R~0~ formula

Let's review our most basic SIR compartmental model framework:

![](images/sir_model_intro.png){width="482"}

Individuals are categorized into three compartments based on their infection status: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R).

Susceptible individuals have no immunity to the disease and will become infected upon successful transmission from an Infected individual. Infected individuals are those who have the pathogen and are capable of transmitting it to others (i.e., the model assumes that infected individuals are also *infectious*). Recovered individuals are those who have already been infected, and are now immune to reinfection.

-   The parameter $\beta$ is the instantaneous transmission rate.

-   The parameter $\gamma$ is the instantaneous recovery rate.

-   By definition, $S + I + R = N$

R~0~ can be calculated from the ODEs, without using numerical integration. Depend on the specific ODEs for an SIR-type model, which have many variations, the mathematical formula for R~0~ will be different. In this lesson, we will consider R~0~ equations for the density-dependent SIR model and the frequency-dependent SIR model.

::: recap
**SIR model ODEs for density-dependent transmission vs. frequency-dependent transmission**

The key difference between density-dependent transmission (DD) and frequency-dependent transmission (FD) is the assumed relationship between population density (N/A) and per capita contact rate (c).

![In DD transmission, the contact rate depends on the population density. In FD transmission, the contact rate does not depend on the population density.](images/dd_fd_contact_rate_function_simple.png){width="415"}

This results in a difference in transmission terms: $\beta SI$ for DD and $\frac{\beta SI}{N}$ for FD. This leads to the following equations:

$$ DD:  \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I $$

$$ FD:   \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I $$
:::

## R~0~ for density-dependent transmission

If we assume density-dependent transmission the transmission term is $\beta S I$. Thus, the rates of change in state variables are described by these ODEs:

$\frac{d S}{d t} = - \beta S I$

$\frac{d I}{d t} = \beta S I - \gamma I$

$\frac{d R}{d t} = \gamma I$

For the disease to invade a population, we require $\frac{dI}{dt} > 0$.

$$
\beta S I - \gamma I > 0
$$

We can rearrange that to get:

$$
\beta S I > \gamma I
$$

This makes sense, because if you think back to the bathtub "flow" model, βSI is the inflow rate, and γI is the outflow rate. When the inflow rate is greater than the outflow rate, that's when the epidemic is growing (the number of infecteds in increasing).

Remember that R~0~ is the expected number of cases generated by one infectious case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immune. Therefore, the initial conditions for calculating R~0~ are:

-   $S(0) = N - 1 \approx N$

-   $I(0) = 1$

-   $R(0) = 0$

To find $R_0$, assume $S = N$ and $I = 1$, leading to the equation:

$$
 \beta N > \gamma
$$

Divide by $\gamma$ to give:

$$
\frac{\beta N}{\gamma} > 1
$$

Thus, the condition for disease invasion is:

$$
\frac{\beta N}{\gamma} > 1
$$

This is known as the invasion threshold.

Therefore, R~0~ for the SIR model above with **density-dependent transmission** is calculated by this equation:

$$
R_0 = \frac{\beta N}{\gamma}
$$

**Practice Question 2**

A. Disease measles modeled by density-dependent transmission. True or false?

B. In a population of 500 individuals with measles, knowing that measles has an infectious period of about 14 days and a $\beta$ of 0.002. Calculate $R_0$.
:::

## R~0~ for frequency-dependent transmission

The rates of change in state variables are described by these differential equations:

-   $\frac{d S}{d t} = - \frac{\beta S I}{N}$
-   $\frac{d I}{d t} = \frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I$
-   $\frac{d R}{d t} = \gamma I$

For the disease to invade a population, we require $\frac{dI}{dt} > 0$.

$$
\frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I > 0
$$

We can rearrange that to get:

$$
\frac{\beta S I}{N} > \gamma I
$$

Once again we can assume that $S = N$ and $I = 1$, leading to the condition:

$$ \beta > \gamma $$

Divide by $\gamma$ to give:

$$ \frac{\beta}{\gamma} > 1  $$

This condition for disease invasion.

Therefore, R~0~ for the SIR model above with **frequency-dependent transmission** is calculated by this equation:

$$ R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} $$

**Practice Question 3**

A. An STI would be modeled by density-dependent transmission. True or false?

B. In a population of 1200 individuals with HIV, with an average infectious period of 10 years and a $\beta$ of 0.4. Calculate $R_0$.
:::

# Implications of R~0~

For the SIR model, the ratio β/γ gives number of secondary cases will be infected before the index case recovers. Hence, R~0~ depends on both properties of the pathogen and properties of the population into which it is introduced.

![Basic reproduction number vs. model parameters when R0 = β/γ](images/R0_params.png)

R~0~ values help determine whether a disease will spread or decline in a community. if R~0~ is less than 1, the disease will die out in a population. On the other hand, if R~0~ is greater than 1, the disease will spread.

R~0~ also helps predict the epidemic trajectory and the severity of the disease. R~0~ can estimate how long an epidemic will last, and the proportion of the population affected.

![The higher the R~0~, the faster the epidemic.](images/effect_r0_epi_curves_CDC_2007.png){width="622"}

The figure below shows the expected trajectories for five diseases, assuming the parameters shown in the table.

![Examples of expected shapes of some infectious disease epidemics.](images/clipboard-2199018617.png)

# Limitations of R~0~

**R~0~ is not a universal property of a pathogen**. It depends on the contact rates and contact structure. For example, the R~0~ for HIV among MSM population in London is drastically different than the R~0~ for HIV among female sex workers (FSW) in Kenya.

![](images/estimates_of_R0.png){width="519"}

Another caveat to consider is that R~0~ is only appropriate under specific starting conditions at the beginning of an epidemic. As the **disease spreads, the number of susceptible individuals decreases, and R~0~ becomes an overestimate** (because the whole populations is no longer in the S category).

When the percentage of susceptibles decreases, there is a "wastage" of contact. Even though the average number of contacts per individual remains the same, the likelihood of contact between S and I individuals is decreasing.

As the epidemic grows, the effective reproduction number (R~e~), becomes a more accurate measure of disease transmission. We will look at R~e~ in detail in the next lesson.

# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

In this lesson, we explored the concept of invasion thresholds, the basic reproduction number (R~0~), and their role in understanding infectious disease dynamics. We learned to calculate R~0~ for a given infectious disease model. We also covered key implications of R~0~ and its limitations.

# Answer Key {.unnumbered}

**Practice Question 1**

**FALSE**. R~0~ is an the *average* number of expected cases. For example, the following figure illustrates the beginning of an epidemic with an R~0~ of 2.

![Example of chain of infection when the reproduction number is 2. Each infectious person 'produces' on average 2 other infectious individuals.](images/r0_of_2_average.png){width="363"}

**Practice Question 2**

A)  **TRUE**. Measles is an airborne pathogen which can be contracted by breathing the same air an infectious individual. The rate of contact is expected to increase with population density, therefore it is typically modeled assuming density-dependent transmission.

B)  **R~0~ is 14**. For the simple density-dependent SIR model (with constant population size, no births or deaths), R~0~ is calculated by the equation:

$$ R_0 = \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} $$

Given that $\beta$ = 0.002, and $N$ = 500, we need to know $\gamma$ in order to calculate $R_0$. Recall that $1/ \gamma$ is the mean value of the infectious period. Therefore, $\gamma = 1/14 = 0.07142857$ and

$$ R_0 = \frac{0.002*500}{0.07142857} = 14 $$

**Practice Question 3**

A)  **FALSE**. The rate of sexual contact is not expected to increase with population density, therefore sexually-transmitted diseases are typically modeled assuming frequency-dependent transmission.

3B) **R~0~ is 4**. For the simple frequency-dependent SIR model (with constant population size, no births or deaths), R~0~ is calculated by the equation:

$$ R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} $$

Given that $\beta$ = 0.4, we need to know $\gamma$ in order to calculate $R_0$. Recall that $1/ \gamma$ is the mean value of the infectious period. Therefore, $\gamma = 1/10 = 0.1$ and

$$ R_0 = \frac{0.4}{0.1} = 4 $$
